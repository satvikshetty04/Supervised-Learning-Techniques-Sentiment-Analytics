**Objective:**

In this project, you will perform sentiment analysis over IMDB movie reviews and Twitter data. Your goal will be to classify tweets or movie reviews as either positive or negative. For classification, you will experiment with logistic regression as well as a Naive Bayes classifier.A major part of this project is the task of generating feature vectors for use in these classifiers. You will explore two methods: 
- A more traditional NLP technique where the features are simply “important” words and the feature vectors are simple binary vectors 
- The Doc2Vec technique where document vectors are learned via artificial neural networks
